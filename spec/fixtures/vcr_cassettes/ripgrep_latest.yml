        12.1.1 is a patch release that fixes a couple small bugs. In\r\nparticular,
        the ripgrep 12.1.0 release did not tag new releases for all of its\r\nin-tree
        dependencies. As a result, ripgrep built dependencies from crates.io\r\nwould
        produce a different build than compiling ripgrep from source on the\r\n`12.1.0`
        tag. Namely, some crates like `grep-cli` had unreleased changes.\r\n\r\nIn
        case you haven''t heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\ntool
        that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.\r\nBy
        default, ripgrep will respect your gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\nhidden
        files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #1581](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1581):\r\n  Corrects
