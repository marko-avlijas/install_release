        12.1.1 is a patch release that fixes a couple small bugs. In\r\nparticular,
        the ripgrep 12.1.0 release did not tag new releases for all of its\r\nin-tree
        dependencies. As a result, ripgrep built dependencies from crates.io\r\nwould
        produce a different build than compiling ripgrep from source on the\r\n`12.1.0`
        tag. Namely, some crates like `grep-cli` had unreleased changes.\r\n\r\nIn
        case you haven''t heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\ntool
        that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.\r\nBy
        default, ripgrep will respect your gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\nhidden
        files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #1581](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1581):\r\n  Corrects
        some egregious markup output in `--help`.\r\n* [BUG #1591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1591):\r\n  Mention
        the special `$0` capture group in docs for the `-r/--replace` flag.\r\n* [BUG

        documentation improvements. This release also contains some important\r\nnotices
        for downstream packagers.\r\n\r\nIn case you haven''t heard of it before,
        ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\ntool that recursively searches your current
        directory for a regex pattern. By\r\ndefault, ripgrep will respect your `.gitignore`
        and automatically skip hidden\r\nfiles/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\n**Notices

        12 is a new major version release of ripgrep that contains many bug\r\nfixes,
        several important performance improvements and a few minor new features.\r\n\r\nIn
        case you haven''t heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\ntool
        that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By\r\ndefault,
        ripgrep will respect your `.gitignore` and automatically skip hidden\r\nfiles/directories
        and binary files.\r\n\r\nIn a near future release, I am hoping to add an\r\n[indexing
        feature](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1497)\r\nto ripgrep,
        which will dramatically speed up searching by building an index.\r\nFeedback
        would very much be appreciated, especially on the user experience\r\nwhich
        will be difficult to get right.\r\n\r\nThis release has no known breaking
        changes.\r\n\r\nDeprecations:\r\n\r\n* The `--no-pcre2-unicode` flag is deprecated.
        Instead, use the `--no-unicode`\r\n  flag, which applies to both the default
        regex engine and PCRE2. For now,\r\n  `--no-pcre2-unicode` and `--pcre2-unicode`
        are aliases to `--no-unicode`\r\n  and `--unicode`, respectively. The `--[no-]pcre2-unicode`
        flags may be\r\n  removed in a future release.\r\n* The `--auto-hybrid-regex`
        flag is deprecated. Instead, use the new `--engine`\r\n  flag with the `auto`
        value.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1087](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1087):\r\n  ripgrep
        is smarter when detected literals are whitespace.\r\n* [PERF #1381](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1381):\r\n  Directory
        traversal is sped up with speculative ignore-file existence checks.\r\n* [PERF
        cd8ec38a](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/cd8ec38a):\r\n  Improve
        inner literal detection to cover more cases more effectively.\r\n  e.g., `
        +Sherlock Holmes +` now has ` Sherlock Holmes ` extracted instead\r\n  of
        ` `.\r\n* [PERF 6a0e0147](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/6a0e0147):\r\n  Improve
        literal detection when the `-w/--word-regexp` flag is used.\r\n* [PERF ad97e9c9](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/ad97e9c9):\r\n  Improve
        overall performance of the `-w/--word-regexp` flag.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n*
        Added or improved file type filtering for erb, diff, Gradle, HAML, Org,\r\n  Postscript,
        Skim, Slim, Slime, RPM Spec files, Typoscript, xml.\r\n* [FEATURE #1370](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1370):\r\n  Add
        `--include-zero` flag that shows files searched without matches.\r\n* [FEATURE
        #1390](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1390):\r\n  Add `--no-context-separator`
        flag that always hides context separators.\r\n* [FEATURE #1414](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1414):\r\n  Add
        `--no-require-git` flag to allow ripgrep to respect gitignores anywhere.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #1420](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1420):\r\n  Add
        `--no-ignore-exclude` to disregard rules in `.git/info/exclude` files.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #1466](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1466):\r\n  Add
        `--no-ignore-files` flag to disable all `--ignore-file` flags.\r\n* [FEATURE
        #1488](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1488):\r\n  Add ''--engine''
        flag for easier switching between regex engines.\r\n* [FEATURE 75cbe88f](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/75cbe88f):\r\n  Add
        `--no-unicode` flag. This works on all supported regex engines.\r\n\r\nBug
        fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #1291](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1291):\r\n  ripgrep
        now works in non-existent directories.\r\n* [BUG #1319](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1319):\r\n  Fix
        match bug due to errant literal detection.\r\n* [**BUG #1335**](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1335):\r\n  Fixes
        a performance bug when searching plain text files with very long lines.\r\n  This
        was a serious performance regression in some cases.\r\n* [BUG #1344](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1344):\r\n  Document
        usage of `--type all`.\r\n* [BUG #1389](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1389):\r\n  Fixes
        a bug where ripgrep would panic when searching a symlinked directory.\r\n*
        [BUG #1439](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1439):\r\n  Improve
        documentation for ripgrep''s automatic stdin detection.\r\n* [BUG #1441](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1441):\r\n  Remove
        CPU features from man page.\r\n* [BUG #1442](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1442),\r\n  [BUG

        11 is a new major version release of ripgrep that contains many bug\nfixes,
        some performance improvements and a few feature enhancements. Notably,\nripgrep''s
        user experience for binary file filtering has been improved. See the\n[guide''s
        new section on binary data](GUIDE.md#binary-data) for more details.\n\nIn
        case you haven''t heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\ntool
        that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By\ndefault,
        ripgrep will respect your `.gitignore` and automatically skip hidden\nfiles/directories
        and binary files.\n\nThis release also marks a change in ripgrep''s versioning.
        Where as the previous\nversion was `0.10.0`, this version is `11.0.0`. Moving
        forward, ripgrep''s\nmajor version will be increased a few times per year.
        ripgrep will continue to\nbe conservative with respect to backwards compatibility,
        but may occasionally\nintroduce breaking changes, which will always be documented
        in this CHANGELOG.\nSee [issue 1172](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1172)
        for a bit\nmore detail on why this versioning change was made.\n\nThis release
        increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.28.0 to\n1.34.0.\n\n**BREAKING
        CHANGES**:\n\n* ripgrep has tweaked its exit status codes to be more like
        GNU grep''s. Namely,\n  if a non-fatal error occurs during a search, then
        ripgrep will now always\n  emit a `2` exit status code, regardless of whether
        a match is found or not.\n  Previously, ripgrep would only emit a `2` exit
        status code for a catastrophic\n  error (e.g., regex syntax error). One exception
        to this is if ripgrep is run\n  with `-q/--quiet`. In that case, if an error
        occurs and a match is found,\n  then ripgrep will exit with a `0` exit status
        code.\n* Supplying the `-u/--unrestricted` flag three times is now equivalent
        to\n  supplying `--no-ignore --hidden --binary`. Previously, `-uuu` was equivalent\n  to
        `--no-ignore --hidden --text`. The difference is that `--binary` disables\n  binary
        file filtering without potentially dumping binary data into your\n  terminal.
        That is, `rg -uuu foo` should now be equivalent to `grep -r foo`.\n* The `avx-accel`
        feature of ripgrep has been removed since it is no longer\n  necessary. All
        uses of AVX in ripgrep are now enabled automatically via\n  runtime CPU feature
        detection. The `simd-accel` feature does remain available\n  (only for enabling
        SIMD for transcoding), however, it does increase\n  compilation times substantially
        at the moment.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n* [PERF #497](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/497),\n  [PERF
        #838](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/838):\n  Make `rg -F -f
        dictionary-of-literals` much faster.\n\nFeature enhancements:\n\n* Added or
        improved file type filtering for Apache Thrift, ASP, Bazel, Brotli,\n  BuildStream,
        bzip2, C, C++, Cython, gzip, Java, Make, Postscript, QML, Tex,\n  XML, xz,
        zig and zstd.\n* [FEATURE #855](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/855):\n  Add
        `--binary` flag for disabling binary file filtering.\n* [FEATURE #1078](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1078):\n  Add

        `--auto-hybrid-regex` flag for automatically falling back to PCRE2.\n* [FEATURE
        #1159](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1159):\n  ripgrep''s exit
        status logic should now match GNU grep. See updated man page.\n* [FEATURE

        for case insensitive ignore globs.\n* [FEATURE #1185](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1185):\n  Add
        `-I` flag as a short option for the `--no-filename` flag.\n* [FEATURE #1207](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1207):\n  Add
        `none` value to `-E/--encoding` to forcefully disable all transcoding.\n*

        is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory
        for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore rules. ripgrep has first
        class support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available
        for every release. ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The
        Silver Searcher, ack and grep.\r\n\r\nThis is a new minor version release
        of ripgrep that contains some major new\r\nfeatures, a huge number of bug
        fixes, and is the first release based on\r\nlibripgrep. The entirety of ripgrep''s
        core search and printing code has been\r\nrewritten and generalized so that
        anyone can make use of it.\r\n\r\nMajor new features include PCRE2 support,
        multi-line search and a JSON output\r\nformat.\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n*
        The minimum version required to compile Rust has now changed to track the\r\n  latest
        stable version of Rust. Patch releases will continue to compile with\r\n  the
        same version of Rust as the previous patch release, but new minor\r\n  versions
        will use the current stable version of the Rust compile as its\r\n  minimum
        supported version.\r\n* The match semantics of `-w/--word-regexp` have changed
        slightly. They used\r\n  to be `\\b(?:<your pattern>)\\b`, but now it''s\r\n  `(?:^|\\W)(?:<your
        pattern>)(?:$|\\W)`. This matches the behavior of GNU grep\r\n  and is believed
        to be closer to the intended semantics of the flag. See\r\n  [#389](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/389)
        for more details.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* [FEATURE #162](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/162):\r\n  libripgrep
        is now a thing. The primary crate is\r\n  [`grep`](https://docs.rs/grep).\r\n*
        [FEATURE #176](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/176):\r\n  Add
        `-U/--multiline` flag that permits matching over multiple lines.\r\n* [FEATURE

        flag that gives support for look-around and backreferences.\r\n* [FEATURE
        #244](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/244):\r\n  Add `--json`
        flag that prints results in a JSON Lines format.\r\n* [FEATURE #321](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/321):\r\n  Add
        `--one-file-system` flag to skip directories on different file systems.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #404](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/404):\r\n  Add
        `--sort` and `--sortr` flag for more sorting. Deprecate `--sort-files`.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #416](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/416):\r\n  Add
        `--crlf` flag to permit `$` to work with carriage returns on Windows.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #917](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/917):\r\n  The
        `--trim` flag strips prefix whitespace from all lines printed.\r\n* [FEATURE
        #993](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/993):\r\n  Add `--null-data`
        flag, which makes ripgrep use NUL as a line terminator.\r\n* [FEATURE #997](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/997):\r\n  The
        `--passthru` flag now works with the `--replace` flag.\r\n* [FEATURE #1038-1](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1038):\r\n  Add
        `--line-buffered` and `--block-buffered` for forcing a buffer strategy.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #1038-2](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1038):\r\n  Add
        `--pre-glob` for filtering files through the `--pre` flag.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n*
        [BUG #2](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2):\r\n  Searching with

        `-w/--word-regexp` flag now works more intuitively.\r\n* [BUG #643](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/643):\r\n  Detection
        of readable stdin has improved on Windows.\r\n* [BUG #441](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/441),\r\n  [BUG

        is a new minor version release of ripgrep that contains some minor new\r\nfeatures
        and a panoply of bug fixes.\r\n\r\nReleases provided on Github for `x86_64`
        will now work on all target CPUs, and\r\nwill also automatically take advantage
        of features found on modern CPUs (such\r\nas AVX2) for additional optimizations.\r\n\r\nThis
        release increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.20.0 to\r\n1.23.0.\r\n\r\nIt
        is anticipated that the next release of ripgrep (0.10.0) will provide\r\nmulti-line
        search support and a JSON output format.\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n*
        When `--count` and `--only-matching` are provided simultaneously, the\r\n  behavior
        of ripgrep is as if the `--count-matches` flag was given. That is,\r\n  the
        total number of matches is reported, where there may be multiple matches\r\n  per
        line. Previously, the behavior of ripgrep was to report the total number\r\n  of
        matching lines. (Note that this behavior diverges from the behavior of\r\n  GNU
        grep.)\r\n* Octal syntax is no longer supported. ripgrep previously accepted
        expressions\r\n  like `\\1` as syntax for matching `U+0001`, but ripgrep will
        now report an\r\n  error instead.\r\n* The `--line-number-width` flag has
        been removed. Its functionality was not\r\n  carefully considered with all
        ripgrep output formats.\r\n  See [#795](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/795)
        for more\r\n  details.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved
        file type filtering for Android, Bazel, Fuschia, Haskell,\r\n  Java and Puppet.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #411](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/411):\r\n  Add
        a `--stats` flag, which emits aggregate statistics after search results.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #646](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/646):\r\n  Add
        a `--no-ignore-messages` flag, which suppresses parse errors from reading\r\n  `.ignore`
        and `.gitignore` files.\r\n* [FEATURE #702](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/702):\r\n  Support
        `\\u{..}` Unicode escape sequences.\r\n* [FEATURE #812](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/812):\r\n  Add
        `-b/--byte-offset` flag that shows the byte offset of each matching line.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #814](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/814):\r\n  Add
        `--count-matches` flag, which is like `--count`, but for each match.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #880](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/880):\r\n  Add
        a `--no-column` flag, which disables column numbers in the output.\r\n* [FEATURE
        #898](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/898):\r\n  Add support
        for `lz4` when using the `-z/--search-zip` flag.\r\n* [FEATURE #924](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/924):\r\n  `termcolor`
        has moved to its own repository:\r\n  https://github.com/BurntSushi/termcolor\r\n*
        [FEATURE #934](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/934):\r\n  Add
        a new flag, `--no-ignore-global`, that permits disabling global\r\n  gitignores.\r\n*
        [FEATURE #967](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/967):\r\n  Rename
        `--maxdepth` to `--max-depth` for consistency. Keep `--maxdepth` for\r\n  backwards
        compatibility.\r\n* [FEATURE #978](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/978):\r\n  Add
        a `--pre` option to filter inputs with an arbitrary program.\r\n* [FEATURE
        fca9709d](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/fca9709d):\r\n  Improve
        zsh completion.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #135](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/135):\r\n  Release
        portable binaries that conditionally use SSSE3, AVX2, etc., at\r\n  runtime.\r\n*
        [BUG #268](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/268):\r\n  Print descriptive
        error message when trying to use look-around or\r\n  backreferences.\r\n*
        [BUG #395](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/395):\r\n  Show comprehensible
        error messages for regexes like `\\s*{`.\r\n* [BUG #526](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/526):\r\n  Support
        backslash escapes in globs.\r\n* [BUG #795](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/795):\r\n  Fix
        problems with `--line-number-width` by removing it.\r\n* [BUG #832](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/832):\r\n  Clarify
        usage instructions for `-f/--file` flag.\r\n* [BUG #835](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/835):\r\n  Fix
        small performance regression while crawling very large directory trees.\r\n*

        is a new minor version releae of ripgrep that satisfies several popular\r\nfeature
        requests (config files, search compressed files, true colors), fixes\r\nmany
        bugs and improves the quality of life for ripgrep maintainers. This\r\nrelease
        also includes greatly improved documentation in the form of a\r\n[User Guide](GUIDE.md)
        and a [FAQ](FAQ.md).\r\n\r\nThis release increases the **minimum supported
        Rust version** from 1.17 to\r\n1.20.\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\nNote
        that these are all very minor and unlikely to impact most users.\r\n\r\n*
        In order to support configuration files, flag overrides needed to be\r\n  rethought.
        In some cases, this changed ripgrep''s behavior. For example,\r\n  in ripgrep
        0.7.1, `rg foo -s -i` will perform a case sensitive search\r\n  since the
        `-s/--case-sensitive` flag was defined to always take precedence\r\n  over
        the `-i/--ignore-case` flag, regardless of position. In ripgrep 0.8.0\r\n  however,
        the override rule for all flags has changed to \"the most recent\r\n  flag
        wins among competing flags.\" That is, `rg foo -s -i` now performs a\r\n  case
        insensitive search.\r\n* The `-M/--max-columns` flag was tweaked so that specifying
        a value of `0`\r\n  now makes ripgrep behave as if the flag was absent. This
        makes it possible\r\n  to set a default value in a configuration file and
        then override it. The\r\n  previous ripgrep behavior was to suppress all matching
        non-empty lines.\r\n* In all globs, `[^...]` is now equivalent to `[!...]`
        (indicating class\r\n  negation). Previously, `^` had no special significance
        in a character class.\r\n* For **downstream packagers**, the directory hierarchy
        in ripgrep''s archive\r\n  releases has changed. The root directory now only
        contains the executable,\r\n  README and license. There is now a new directory
        called `doc` which contains\r\n  the man page (previously in the root), a
        user guide (new), a FAQ (new) and\r\n  the CHANGELOG (previously not included
        in release). The `complete`\r\n  directory remains the same.\r\n\r\nFeature
        enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved file type filtering for\r\n  Apache
        Avro, C++, GN, Google Closure Templates, Jupyter notebooks, man pages,\r\n  Protocol
        Buffers, Smarty and Web IDL.\r\n* [FEATURE #196](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/196):\r\n  Support
        a configuration file. See\r\n  [the new user guide](GUIDE.md#configuration-file)\r\n  for
        details.\r\n* [FEATURE #261](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/261):\r\n  Add
        extended or \"true\" color support. Works in Windows 10!\r\n  [See the FAQ

        is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes one minor breaking\r\nchange,
        bug fixes and several new features including support for text encodings\r\nother
        than UTF-8.\r\n\r\nA notable accomplishment with respect to Rust is that ripgrep
        proper now only\r\ncontains a single `unsafe` use (for accessing the contents
        of a memory map).\r\n\r\nThe **breaking change** is:\r\n\r\n* [FEATURE #380](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380):\r\n  Line
        numbers are now hidden by default when ripgrep is printing to a tty\r\n  **and**
        the only thing searched is stdin.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added
        or improved file type filtering for Ceylon, CSS, Elixir, HTML, log,\r\n  SASS,
        SVG, Twig\r\n* [FEATURE #1](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1):\r\n  Add
        support for additional text encodings, including automatic detection for\r\n  UTF-16
        via BOM sniffing. Explicit text encoding support with the\r\n  `-E/--encoding`
        flag was also added for latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP\r\n  and Shift_JIS, among others.
        The full list can be found here:\r\n  https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get\r\n*
        [FEATURE #129](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/129):\r\n  Add
        a new `-M/--max-columns` flag that omits lines longer than the given\r\n  number
        of bytes. (Disabled by default!)\r\n* [FEATURE #369](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/369):\r\n  A
        new flag, `--max-filesize`, was added for limiting searches to files with\r\n  a
        maximum file size.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #52](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/52),\r\n  [BUG
        #311](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/311):\r\n  Tweak how binary
        files are detected and handled. (We are slightly less\r\n  conservative and
        will no longer use memory without bound.)\r\n* [BUG #326](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326):\r\n  When
        --files flag is given, we should never attempt to parse positional\r\n  arguments
        as regexes.\r\n* [BUG #327](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/327):\r\n  Permit
        the --heading flag to override the --no-heading flag.\r\n* [BUG #340](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/340):\r\n  Clarify
        that the `-u/--unrestricted` flags are aliases.\r\n* [BUG #343](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/343):\r\n  Global
        git ignore config should use `$HOME/.config/git/ignore` and not\r\n  `$HOME/git/ignore`.\r\n*
        [BUG #345](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/345):\r\n  Clarify docs
        for `-g/--glob` flag.\r\n* [BUG #381](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/381):\r\n  Add
        license files to each sub-crate.\r\n* [BUG #383](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/383):\r\n  Use
        latest version of clap (for argv parsing).\r\n* [BUG #392](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/391):\r\n  Fix
        translation of set globs (e.g., `{foo,bar,quux}`) to regexes.\r\n* [BUG #401](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/401):\r\n  Add
        PowerShell completion file to Windows release.\r\n* [BUG #405](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/405):\r\n  Fix

        is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes a couple very\nminor
        breaking changes, a few new features and lots of bug fixes.\n\nThis version
        of ripgrep upgrades its `regex` dependency from `0.1` to `0.2`,\nwhich includes
        a few minor syntax changes:\n- POSIX character classes now require double
        bracketing. Previously, the regex\n  `[:upper:]` would parse as the `upper`
        POSIX character class. Now it parses\n  as the character class containing
        the characters `:upper:`. The fix to this\n  change is to use `[[:upper:]]`
        instead. Note that variants like\n  `[[:upper:][:blank:]]` continue to work.\n-
        The character `[` must always be escaped inside a character class.\n- The
        characters `&`, `-` and `~` must be escaped if any one of them are\n  repeated
        consecutively. For example, `[&]`, `[\\&]`, `[\\&\\&]`, `[&-&]` are all\n  equivalent
        while `[&&]` is illegal. (The motivation for this and the prior\n  change
        is to provide a backwards compatible path for adding character class\n  set
        notation.)\n\nFeature enhancements:\n- Added or improved file type filtering
        for Crystal, Kotlin, Perl, PowerShell,\n  Ruby, Swig\n- [FEATURE #83](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/83):\n  Type
        definitions can now include other type definitions.\n- [FEATURE #243](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243):\n  **BREAKING
        CHANGE**: The `--column` flag now implies `--line-number`.\n- [FEATURE #263](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/263):\n  Add
        a new `--sort-files` flag.\n- [FEATURE #275](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/275):\n  Add
        a new `--path-separator` flag. Useful in cygwin.\n\nBug fixes:\n- [BUG #182](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182):\n  Redux:
        use more portable ANSI color escape sequences when possible.\n- [BUG #258](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/258):\n  Fix
        bug that caused ripgrep''s parallel iterator to spin and burn CPU.\n- [BUG

        install shell completion files.\n- [BUG #268](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/268):\n  Make
        lack of backreference support more explicit.\n- [BUG #271](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/271):\n  Remove
        `~` dependency on clap.\n- [BUG #277](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/277):\n  Fix
        cosmetic issue in `globset` crate docs.\n- [BUG #279](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/279):\n  ripgrep
        did not terminate when `-q/--quiet` was given.\n- [BUG #281](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/281):\n  **BREAKING
        CHANGE**: Completely remove `^C` handling from ripgrep.\n- [BUG #284](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/284):\n  Make
        docs for `-g/--glob` clearer.\n- [BUG #286](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/286):\n  When
        stdout is redirected to a file, don''t search that file.\n- [BUG #287](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/287):\n  Fix
        ZSH completions.\n- [BUG #295](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/295):\n  Remove

        is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes two breaking\nchanges
        with lots of bug fixes and some new features and performance\nimprovements.
        Notably, if you had a problem with colors or piping on Windows\nbefore, then
        that should now be fixed in this release.\n\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\n- ripgrep
        now requires Rust 1.11 to compile. Previously, it could build on\n  Rust 1.9.
        The cause of this was the move from\n  [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)\n  for
        argument parsing.\n- The `-e/--regexp` flag can no longer accept a pattern
        starting with a `-`.\n  There are two work-arounds: `rg -- -foo` and `rg [-]foo`
        or `rg -e [-]foo`\n  will all search for the same `-foo` pattern. The cause
        of this was the move\n  from [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)\n  for
        argument parsing.\n  [This may get fixed in the\n  future.](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/742).\n\nPerformance
        improvements:\n- [PERF #33](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/33):\n  ripgrep
        now performs similar to GNU grep on small corpora.\n- [PERF #136](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/136):\n  ripgrep
        no longer slows down because of argument parsing when given a large\n  argument
        list.\n\nFeature enhancements:\n- Added or improved file type filtering for
        Elixir.\n- [FEATURE #7](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/7):\n  Add
        a `-f/--file` flag that causes ripgrep to read patterns from a file.\n- [FEATURE
        #51](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/51):\n  Add a `--colors`
        flag that enables one to customize the colors used in\n  ripgrep''s output.\n-
        [FEATURE #138](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/138):\n  Add a
        `--files-without-match` flag that shows only file paths that contain\n  zero
        matches.\n- [FEATURE #230](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/230):\n  Add
        completion files to the release (Bash, Fish and PowerShell).\n\nBug fixes:\n-
        [BUG #37](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/37):\n  Use correct
        ANSI escape sequences when `TERM=screen.linux`.\n- [BUG #94](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/94):\n  ripgrep
        now detects stdin on Windows automatically.\n- [BUG #117](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/117):\n  Colors
        should now work correctly and automatically inside mintty.\n- [BUG #182](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182):\n  Colors
        should now work within Emacs. In particular, `--color=always` will\n  emit
        colors regardless of the current environment.\n- [BUG #189](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/189):\n  Show
        less content when running `rg -h`. The full help content can be\n  accessed
        with `rg --help`.\n- [BUG #210](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/210):\n  Support
        non-UTF-8 file names on Unix platforms.\n- [BUG #231](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/231):\n  Switch
        from block buffering to line buffering.\n- [BUG #241](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/241):\n  Some

        12.1.1 is a patch release that fixes a couple small bugs. In\r\nparticular,
        the ripgrep 12.1.0 release did not tag new releases for all of its\r\nin-tree
        dependencies. As a result, ripgrep built dependencies from crates.io\r\nwould
        produce a different build than compiling ripgrep from source on the\r\n`12.1.0`
        tag. Namely, some crates like `grep-cli` had unreleased changes.\r\n\r\nIn
        case you haven''t heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\ntool
        that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.\r\nBy
        default, ripgrep will respect your gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\nhidden
        files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #1581](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1581):\r\n  Corrects
        some egregious markup output in `--help`.\r\n* [BUG #1591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1591):\r\n  Mention
        the special `$0` capture group in docs for the `-r/--replace` flag.\r\n* [BUG
        #1602](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1602):\r\n  Fix failing
        test resulting from out-of-sync dependencies."}'
